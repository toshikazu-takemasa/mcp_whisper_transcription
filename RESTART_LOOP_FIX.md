# MCP Whisper Transcription - Restart Loop Fix

## Quick Fix for Restart Loop Issue

The MCP server was experiencing continuous restart loops. This has been resolved with the following fixes:

### 1. **Immediate Steps to Fix**

1. **Set your OpenAI API Key** in the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   AUDIO_FILES_PATH=/app/audio_files
   ```

2. **Rebuild Docker container** (important - must rebuild to apply fixes):
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```

### 2. **What Was Fixed**

- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Created `.env` file with proper defaults
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Enhanced main entry point with logging and error handling
- ✅ **Docker Configuration**: Improved healthcheck settings to prevent premature restarts
- ✅ **Directory Structure**: Ensured required directories exist in container
- ✅ **Logging**: Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for immediate log output

### 3. **Verification**

After rebuilding and starting, you should see:
```
mcp-whisper-transcription | INFO:__main__:Starting MCP Whisper Transcription Server...
```

Instead of the previous restart loop logs.

### 4. **Troubleshooting**

If issues persist, run the debug script inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it mcp-whisper-transcription /app/scripts/debug-server.sh
```

### 5. **Key Changes Made**

- **Main Entry Point**: Simplified with proper error handling and logging
- **Docker Healthcheck**: Extended intervals (30s→60s) and timeouts (10s→15s)
- **Environment**: Added default values and required directory creation
- **Debugging**: Added comprehensive debug script for troubleshooting

The server should now start cleanly without restart loops.
